# Movie-View
> This project was built with vue-cli

## Idea
Movie View is an application that lets you see a list of movies by most recent. For each movie displayed you can view more details such as the summary and actors in the movie.

## API
Movie-View uses both the The Movie Reviews API (NY Times) and the IMDB API

## Tech Deets
With Movie View, I'd like to achieve a functioning app using Vue.js, Node.js, and Webpack.

## Build Setup
Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/yxnely/movie-vue.git`

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

You're good to start playing around in the dev environment!
