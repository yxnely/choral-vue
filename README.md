# Choral

The project "Choral", but remade with Vue.js

## Idea
Choral is a platform that allows musicians/artists/anybody, to share short snippets of lyrics or a poem to display their work. On Choral you will be able to post lyrics, reply to a post, "like", "follow" and more! Choral aims to help a community to create more and provide inspiration.

## Challenge
* Create design style
* Set up account management
* Add user engagement functionality
* Responsive design

## Tech Deets
With Choral, I'd like to achieve a functioning app using Vue.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Webpack.

## Run Locally
Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/yxnely/choral-vue.git`

Run `npm install`

Run `npm start dev`

You're good to start playing around in the dev environment!
